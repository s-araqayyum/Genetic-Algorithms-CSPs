    This assignment requires the optimization of the scheduling of exams for a university with N courses but K exam halls
    The constraints are, however, the following:
        → A course has a specific set of timeslots for its exam
        → Each exam hall can only be used for a certain number of hours
        → There can be conflicting students ( do not pair exams together )
    Your task is to use a genetic algorithm to find a feasible and optimal schedule.
